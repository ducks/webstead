I've created a detailed spec for implementing the FederatePostJob that handles ActivityPub federation delivery. Here's what the spec covers:

**Core functionality:**
- Background job that delivers Create(Note) activities to follower inboxes
- Exponential backoff retry logic (3 attempts: 3s, 18s, 83s)
- HTTP Signatures for request authentication
- Batch delivery to all accepted followers

**Key implementation steps:**
1. Generate ActiveJob with retry configuration
2. Build ActivityPub-compliant Create(Note) JSON structure
3. Render markdown to HTML using kramdown
4. Deliver to each follower's inbox (prefer shared_inbox for efficiency)
5. Sign requests with HttpSignatureService from step 17
6. Comprehensive error handling and logging per follower
7. Post model callbacks to auto-enqueue on publish
8. Full test coverage with webmock for HTTP stubbing

**Smart delivery logic:**
- Early returns for draft posts or empty follower lists
- Prefers shared_inbox_url over individual inbox_url (efficiency)
- Per-follower error handling (one failure doesn't fail entire job)
- Success/failure logging with summary counts

**Backup plans include:**
- Debugging strategies for signature verification issues
- Idempotency handling for retry scenarios
- Batching strategies for large follower counts
- Content sanitization approaches for markdown rendering

This completes the announce-only federation delivery pipeline. When combined with steps 13-17 (WebFinger, Actor, Follower model, Inbox, Outbox, HTTP Signatures), this creates a working one-way federation system where webstead posts appear on Mastodon.
