Looking at the proposals, I need to see what we're synthesizing. Let me check if there are multiple proposals in files or if this is asking me to validate/structure the single Claude proposal shown.

Since you're asking me to "synthesize these proposals into consensus" but only showing one proposal, I'll provide the structured output based on that proposal:

```json
{
  "approach": "Build multi-tenant Rails 8 app with subdomain routing, ActivityPub federation, and threaded comments. Start with minimal viable federation (outbound posts only), add bidirectional later. Use Hotwire for reactive UI without heavy JS. PostgreSQL row-level security for tenant isolation.",
  "key_decisions": [
    "Multi-tenant architecture with shared database and row-level security (simpler than separate schemas, scales to thousands of sites)",
    "Subdomain routing first, custom domains via CNAME later (reduces initial complexity)",
    "ActivityPub federation outbound-only for MVP (publish to fediverse, defer inbound replies)",
    "Hotwire/Turbo over React/Vue (matches Rails philosophy, less complexity, still reactive)",
    "Threaded comments with parent_id (simple, proven pattern from Discourse/Reddit)",
    "federated_actors cache table (avoid hitting remote servers for every comment render)",
    "Start with single default theme (defer multi-theme support until post-MVP)",
    "Use Rails 8 built-in authentication (Devise adds complexity for simple use case)"
  ],
